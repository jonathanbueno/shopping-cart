# Shopping Cart

This exercise is part of Rocketseat's IGNITE React course. The idea is to create a shopping cart using React, React Hooks, ContextAPI and localStorage.

The project was started by the course admin and I developed the remaining functions and treatments to run all the tests.

Note: the layout is not on focus here.

## How to run the project

My recommendation is to use YARN. The same used by me in this case :)

How to start the Fake API

```bash
yarn server
```

How to start the Application

```bash
yarn start
```

How to run the Tests

```bash
yarn test
```
